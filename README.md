# Welcome to my personal site repository!  
[Live Site](https://www.hannapitino.com)  

This space is more than just a portfolio â€” it showcases not only my technical skills but also who I am in an immersive 3D experience. I modeled the entire 3D room in Blender from scratch, complete with materials, UV painting, and texture baking. I then brought it to the web using Three.js.
By using my background in front-end development I crafted the layout of the website itself using generic JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Just like how someone's room reflects its inhabitant, this website serves as a glimpse into my learning journey and a creative representation of me.
